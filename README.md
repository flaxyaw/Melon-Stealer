# MelonStealer

**MelonStealer** is a project made for educational purposes, created in a single day just for fun. The code is pretty bad, and I'm fully aware of it. This project **WILL NOT BE MAINTAINED** and is **NOT meant to actually be used**.

### Issues & Pull Requests

Even though the code is horrible, I'm open to issues or pull requests if you'd like to contribute. But don't expect any serious improvements or long-term support.
