# MelonStealer

**MelonStealer** is a project made for educational purposes, created in a single day just for fun. The code is pretty bad, and I'm fully aware of it. This project **WILL NOT BE MAINTAINED** and is **NOT meant to actually be used**.

### Issues & Pull Requests

Even though the code is horrible, I'm open to issues or pull requests if you'd like to contribute. But don't expect any serious improvements or long-term support.

## To-Do List

### *High Priority*:

- [X] **Implement Multi-Browser support** (Brave, Chrome, Opera, Edge etc.)
- [ ] **Add proper error handling and fixes for failure situations + edge cases (not installed browser, browser not running, browser installed on other drive etc.)
- [ ] **Implement Multi-Browser Engine support** (Gecko etc.)
- [ ] **Add Misc features** (Cookie collection, History Collection etc.)

### *Mid Priority*:

- [ ] **Additional things to steal**
- [ ] **Crypto Wallets**
- [ ] **Discord Tokens**
- [ ] **Login Sessions** (Steam, Uplay, Epic etc.)

### *Will Not Be Implemented*:

- [x] ~~**Rat functionality**~~ (Keylogger, Screen / Cam Grab, Persistence, Remote Control etc.)
- [x] ~~**C2 Functionality**~~ (will not implement quick and easy ways to exfiltrate stolen data)
